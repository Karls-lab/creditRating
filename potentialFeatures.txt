I'm working with two merged datasets: appleprev and person. 
I attempted to find all categorical values and one-hot encode them. 
I then ran the dataset through the mrmr algorithm to attempt to find the 
most relevant features.


WE ARE LOOKING AT PERSON AND APPLEPREV_1_0

LIST OF DATE FEATURES:


LIST OF CONTINUOUS/DISCRETE FEATURES:











TODO: determine if any of these values are ordinal 
(to use label encoding instead of one-hot encoding that reduces dimensionality)
Promising Features, for more in-depth analysis, taken from preprocessing/docs/MRMR_pApplindex:

- annuity: an annuity typically refers to a series of equal payments made at regular intervals.
- creationdate: the date the application was created - don't know how to work with dates yet. 
- district: the district of the applicant
- firstnonzeroinstldate: First Non-Zero Installment Date: Date when they started paying
    May remove because I don't know how to work with dates Yet. One-hot encode doesn't make sense
- occupation: Job occupation.
