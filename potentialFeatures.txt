I'm working with two merged datasets: appleprev and person. 
I attempted to find all categorical values and one-hot encode them. 
I then ran the dataset through the mrmr algorithm to attempt to find the 
most relevant features.

TODO: determine if any of these values are ordinal 
(to use label encoding instead of one-hot encoding that reduces dimensionality)
Promising Features, for more in-depth analysis, taken from preprocessing/docs/MRMR_pApplindex:
- annuity 
- creationdate 
- district 
- firstnonzeroinstldate
- occupation
